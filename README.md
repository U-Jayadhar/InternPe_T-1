# InternPe_T-1

## Task-1 of AI-ML Internship at InternPe

_Make a Diabetes Prediction with ML_

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The steps involved include data preprocessing, data standardization, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in the file `diabetes data.csv`. This dataset includes several features related to health metrics and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Project Structure

- `diabetes data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `T1_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository
   ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/U-Jayadhar/InternPe_T-1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd InternPe_T-1
   ```

## Model Building Steps

- Load the Data: Read the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
- Data Standardization: Standardize the feature data to ensure each feature contributes equally to the model.
- Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model on the training set.
- Model Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.

## Evaluation Metrics

- Confusion Matrix: Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.
- Accuracy Score: Measures the overall accuracy of the model.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation are printed at the end of the Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
